Name: Maria
Age: 14
Description: Maria is a happy young girl, interested in having fun with her friends. She is a good student and a very talented young musician too. She enjoys playing the saxophone at the High School Wind Band. In fact this is the most interesting aspect about her, since the Puzzler is about sound and music.
