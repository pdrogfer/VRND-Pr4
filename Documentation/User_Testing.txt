USER TESTING

Questions and feedback:

1. How do you feel your 'size' in relation to the scene and the objects in it?
User: I feel my size is appropriate. The room is big, but the doors and barrels are 'human size', so I must just be in a big room, like a castle salon.

2. How do you feel in the scene. Is the experience comfortable or uncomfortable? Anything else?
User: I feel ok, the only complaint I have is that the image is a bit blurred, the definition is not great. Other than that, it is comfortable. (NOTE: the definition problem is caused by the mobile device used, which is medium-quality)

3. Can you describe the mood of the scene?
User: There is a mistery ambience, the dimmed lights are very nice. Also the color of the orbs makes them intriguing.
