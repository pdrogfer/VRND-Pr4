## Introduction

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017). It showcases all the basic elements of a small game: GUI elements, a virtual world, scene focus/transitions, and game mechanics, all adapted to the special considerations of Virtual Reality content for Google Cardboard.
This game is based on visual and auditory memory and recognition. The Player will enter a misterious dungeon where 5 magical orbs will light up and sound. Only reproducing the sequence correctly will the player be allowed to exit the dungeon.

## Outcomes
Through the development of this game I learned best practices in planning, design, development, testing and documentation of Virtual Reality content. I already had some experience in Unity and also as Android Developer, but the possibilities and constraints of Cardboard VR present some unique challenges to overcome.
