## Introduction

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017). It showcases all the basic elements of a small game: GUI elements, a virtual world, scene focus/transitions, and game mechanics, all adapted to the special considerations of Virtual Reality content for Google Cardboard.
This game is based on visual and auditory memory and recognition. The Player will enter a misterious dungeon where 5 magical orbs will light up and sound. Only reproducing the sequence correctly will the player be allowed to exit the dungeon.

## Outcomes
Through the development of this game I learned best practices in planning, design, development, testing and documentation of Virtual Reality content. I already had some experience in Unity and also as Android Developer, but the possibilities and constraints of Cardboard VR present some unique challenges to overcome.  

## Story of the process
**Statement of Purpose**: Puzzler is a VR game for kids ages 8 - 15, where they will have to memorize and repeat a sequence of 5 elements, each with its unique sound. It is presented as a misterious challenge inside a dark dungeon.

### Persona:
For this project I created a user persona called Maria. Maria is a 14 years old girl, interested in having fun with her friends. She is a good student and a very talented young musician too. She enjoys playing the saxophone at the High School Wind Band. In fact this is the most interesting aspect about her, since the Puzzler is about game and music.
She doesn't have much experience with VR content. Maria does not have a Cardboard or VR set, but has had some VR experience at museums and Gaming Conventions. Maria also loves gaming!

### Sketch:

This was the starting point in the design process. I kept the original idea of a construction isolated among the mountains, and did my best to recreate a lonely natural landscape. I preferred to change the original idea of the aztec building for a much simpler one, to concentrate on other parts of the design.

## User testing outcomes and iteration
I performed frequent iterations of user testing to build the project with the best approach as soon as possible. While the general feedback has been positive, the user helped me improve the experience and find bugs I hadn't noticed. 
**Initial Test**
Questions and feedback:

1. How do you feel your 'size' in relation to the scene and the objects in it?
User: I feel my size is appropriate. The room is big, but the doors and barrels are 'human size', so I must just be in a big room, like a castle salon.

2. How do you feel in the scene. Is the experience comfortable or uncomfortable? Anything else?
User: I feel ok, the only complaint I have is that the image is a bit blurred, the definition is not great. Other than that, it is comfortable. (NOTE: the definition problem is caused by the mobile device used, which is medium-quality)

3. Can you describe the mood of the scene?
User: There is a mistery ambience, the dimmed lights are very nice. Also the color of the orbs makes them intriguing.

**Medium Test**
Once the UI panels were ready, user tested them. She found they were legible and of appropriate size, but the scene transition after pushing the button (and also, after successfully completing the game) was too fast. I slowed it down a bit, tested again, and she found the experience much more comfortable.

**Final Test** 
User suggested a darker default color in the orbs, because it was difficult to see when they were activated (that changes to white, but the original color was indeed too clear).
